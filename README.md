👋 Hi
  
👀 Interests...

Computer programming, science and politics. I love these three fields in no particular order, largely because I tend to seek the underlying connection between things. I am probably the kind of person who would tell you how
computer science and political science are related. My interest lies in finding ways to explain things using computers. I am on a journey of perfecting my ability to simulate everything and anything.

🌱 Learning...

  - Go
  - C
  - PHP

  I am learning these languages for a reason. When it comes to Go, I think it is an awesome language that does the simple things well. If a language can do that, then it becomes easier to compose these tiny things into larger and more complex
  things. In as much as I love Go, there are times when I think modern languages overdo stuff. I prefer C probably for the same reason others hate it. I love pointers and the fact that you need a bit of machine knowledge to program in C at
  an advanced level. Since my idea is to become the best I can possibly be, I use the harder language to program in mostly to get to know how things work at the fundamental level. I can not stop telling you how much I have used the knowledge
   of C to solve problems in other languages. PHP is just awesome and universally available in web hosts. The number of places you can host a random ideas is amazing. The current changes made in PHP are also making it more and more appealing.
  I also prefer the fact that you can count on pure PHP to deliver a quality website instead of using frameworks that at times overdo things.
  
💞️ Collaboration

 Looking to collaborate on golang projects. I think the fact that golang requires less external tools to use, the language is a perfect fit for collaboration. There are fewer choices to make: text framework, how do we build...

⚡ Fun fact: 

    I genuinely believe bioelectricity and genetic programming will be the source of human immortality.
