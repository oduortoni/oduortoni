# Antony Oduor

👋 Hi
  
👀 Interests...

Computer programming, science and politics. I love these three fields in no particular order, largely because I tend to seek the underlying connection between things.

🌱 Languages

  - Go
  - php
  - C
  - JavaScript
  
💞️ Collaboration

 Looking to collaborate on golang projects, but would be open-minded enough to step outside of it.

📫 reach me at:

⚡ Fun fact: 

    I try to code projects I have written in other languges in C in order to get an indepth understanding of the concepts involved.
