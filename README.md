👋 Hi
  
👀 Interests...

Computer programming, science and politics. I love these three fields in no particular order, largely because I tend to seek the underlying connection between things.

🌱 Learning...

  - Go
  - C
  - JavaScript

  I love Go. I think it is an awesome language that does the simple things well. It is easier to compose functions and the module system is a breeze. There are times when I need to understand the implementation details of things. It is during such times that I drop down to C. It helps one understand topics from the first principles while at the same time frustrating them into becoming better at programming. Finally, no one can escape JavaScript. The more you code in it the more you appreciate what it can do and what it has made possible over the years.
  
💞️ Collaboration

 Looking to collaborate on golang projects, but would be open-minded enough to step outside of it.

  Will update...
  
⚡ Fun fact: 

    I try to code projects I have written in other languges in C in order to get an indepth understanding of the concepts involved.
